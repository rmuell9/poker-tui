1. Start with simply text-based terminal game with fixed probabilities for each hand and flop, turn, and river
2. Develop easy, medium, hard, and expert modes that replace the fixed probabilites with a bot engine
3. Create a ui that primarily uses keyboard, but displays an ASCII representation of the cards and maybe chips
