1. Start with a simple text-based terminal game with fixed probabilities for each hand flop, turn, and river
2. Develop easy, medium, hard, and expert modes that replace the fixed probabilites with a bot engine
3. Create a terminal user interface that primarily uses keyboard and displays an ASCII representation of the cards and maybe chips
